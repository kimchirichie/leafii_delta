				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>
					As passionate students, we like to stand out among our peers. So we created
					our own personal websites to showcase our projects, skills, passion and hobbies.
					However, employers can't find our amazing websites if they don't know our urls.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can always Google our names, but the first page of Google is clouded
					with other popular websites such as LinkedIn, Twitter & Facebook; our websites are
					pushed down at the very bottom of Google. As a result, we created
					Leafii, a platform to specifically search for online portfolios.

				<h2>Idea</h2>
				<p>Leafii is a platform that makes online portfolios searchable.
				   Simply submit your website and we will make all the content on your website
				   searchable. No need to fill out templates. We do all the work for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a website is submitted on our platform, our platform will parse all the
					keywords on your website. This way, not only people can find you base on your
					url but also base on the content on your website.
